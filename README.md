# Inventory, Sales & Profitability Analysis 

## Overview
This project applies data analysis techniques to retail business data
to evaluate sales performance, inventory efficiency, and product-level
profitability.

The focus is on transforming raw transactional data into structured,
actionable insights that support operational and financial decision-making.

---

## Business Problem
Retail organizations often face challenges such as:
- Identifying true revenue drivers
- Managing slow-moving or dead inventory
- Understanding profitability beyond top-line sales

This project addresses these challenges by integrating sales, inventory,
and cost data into a single analytical workflow.

---

## Objectives
- Analyze historical sales data to identify trends and seasonality
- Measure inventory turnover to assess inventory efficiency
- Estimate unit costs and calculate gross profit and margins
- Identify underperforming and value-destroying products
- Translate analytical results into actionable business insights

---

## Datasets
The analysis is based on multiple structured retail datasets, including:
- Sales transaction data
- Purchase and invoice records
- Beginning and ending inventory snapshots
- Historical purchase price data

### Data Availability
Due to file size limitations, the raw CSV datasets are not included in this
repository.  
The datasets were provided as part of the internship project and can be
made available upon request.
